Currently, number of unnecessary prostate biopsies are being performed in the United States. This is due to the absence of appropriate biopsy decision-making protocol.  \n**Aim:** To develop and validate a 4K score/multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-based nomogram to predict prostate cancer (PCa), clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), and unfavorable prostate cancer (uPCa). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.345,t=0.352,r=0.916,b=0.485), with ID 6a6d2410-a296-47d4-881b-b6f310faf2a1 -->\n\n**Methods and Results:** Retrospective, single-center study evaluating a cohort of 574 men with 4K score test >7% or suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) or Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores 3, 4, or 5 on mpMRI that underwent systematic and/or mpMRI/ultrasound fusion–targeted prostate biopsy between 2016 and 2020. External cohort included 622 men. csPCa and uPCa were defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4 and ≥4 + 3 on biopsy, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to build nomogram for predicting PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. Validation was performed by plotting the area under the curve (AUC) and comparing nomogram-predicted probabilities with actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa probabilities in the external cohort. 4K score, a PI-RADS ≥4, prostate volume and prior negative biopsy were significant predictors of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. AUCs were 0.84, 0.88, and 0.86 for the prediction of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa, respectively. The predicted and actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa showed agreement across all percentage probability ranges in the validation cohort. Using the prediction model at threshold of 30, 30% of overall biopsies, 41% of benign biopsies, and 19% of diagnosed indolent PCa could be avoided, while missing 9% of csPCa. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.347,t=0.488,r=0.916,b=0.773), with ID 4bc5155f-2280-4968-a7d7-597bfc175493 -->\n\n**Conclusion:** This novel nomogram would reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies and decrease detection of clinically insignificant PCa. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.346,t=0.776,r=0.915,b=0.812), with ID 1e667f27-dd06-40bf-9965-43c935eafdbf -->\n\nKEYWORDS\n4K score test, biopsy, multiparametric MRI, prostate cancer <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.347,t=0.826,r=0.698,b=0.858), with ID ffdb09b2-7cfe-41e5-8efc-2b8274c819b2 -->\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n© 2021 The Authors. *Cancer Reports* published by Wiley Periodicals LLC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.905,r=0.916,b=0.949), with ID 3ec99c57-2e10-4416-95c7-fdf787361aef -->\n\n*Cancer Reports*. 2021;4:e1357.  \nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/cnr2.1357 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.959,r=0.262,b=0.988), with ID 4ff4b61e-0334-47f3-b888-acb43d7bf472 -->\n\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/cnr2 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.663,t=0.958,r=0.854,b=0.973), with ID 4a88b700-cd39-4c3d-a8d6-93589ec24eb8 -->\n\n1 of 9 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.886,t=0.958,r=0.926,b=0.973), with ID 71b0b7df-cbf2-4540-b6e5-26c72895aa60 -->\n\n2 of 9 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.027,r=0.114,b=0.041), with ID 8def453e-d452-489b-97fd-d760f533a78b -->\n\nWILEY\n\nCancer Reports\n\nlogo: stylized globe with interconnected nodes <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.026,r=0.443,b=0.051), with ID 3b35c8dc-2085-4e70-b24a-363e43db565a -->\n\nWAGASKAR ET AL. <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.829,t=0.027,r=0.926,b=0.041), with ID 0f9e4836-aa86-4dbd-884e-470c1becb21b -->\n\n1   |   BACKGROUND\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States, accounting for an estimated 19% of all newly diagnosed cancers in 2018.¹ Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the only molecular marker routinely used for detection of prostate cancer (PCa), and screening with PSA has been shown to reduce prostate cancer mortality.² However, numerous studies have demonstrated the diagnostic limitations of PSA resulting in overdiagnosis of indolent cancers, frequent unnecessary prostate biopsies, the results of which are benign, and overtreatment with significant morbidity.³ Alternative strategies for the detection of significant PCa are needed to avoid potentially morbid, invasive procedures in men who are unlikely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.063,r=0.489,b=0.277), with ID 0cc6a52f-a0b1-4098-bfea-1987e44081a7 -->\n\n4K score test (OPKO Diagnostics, Woburn, MA) is a serum biomarker–based test on a four-kallikrein panel including kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2), intact PSA, free PSA, and total PSA, as well as incorporating clinical information such as biopsy history and DRE findings. The 4K score test has repeatedly been shown to predict prostate cancer (PCa) biopsy outcome in men with elevated PSAs while also significantly reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies.⁴⁻⁶ Furthermore, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in combination with targeted biopsies has emerged as an effective tool to detect clinically significant disease.⁷⁻⁹ Studies combining biomarkers and MRI-targeted biopsies for prostate cancer detection have also been proven to decrease the number of biopsies and avoid over-detection of indolent cancer to an even greater extent.¹⁰ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.075,t=0.280,r=0.490,b=0.494), with ID 1eca7455-825c-4b12-864b-bd51c1742301 -->\n\nAlthough the mpMRI and the 4K score test are both used in American clinical practice for the evaluation of prostate cancer, there are no reports on the impact of using these tests in combination. We hypothesize that both of these tests will provide independent and complementary value, and when combined, will improve the detection of clinically significant disease compared to either test alone.¹¹ The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram using 4K score test and mpMRI to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in men with an elevated PSA and/or abnormal DRE. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.075,t=0.497,r=0.489,b=0.644), with ID fc153c75-8a0b-4478-8090-7d45311255e7 -->\n\n2  |  MATERIAL AND METHODS <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.675,r=0.375,b=0.695), with ID dcd3a655-84d0-4761-882c-171dff1ad7b3 -->\n\n2.1   |   Study population\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed our institution's prostate biopsy data-\nbase to extract relevant patient records.

Men who have con-\ntraindication for prebiopsy mpMRI (n = 10) were excluded. In total,\n574 men were used to build the model (development cohort).

Continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using a Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were reported as rates and were tested with a chi-square test, as appropriate. The prediction model included the following variables: age, family history of prostate cancer, history of negative prior biopsy, 4K score test, DRE findings, mpMRI prostate volume, and highest PI-RADS score. We are aware that 4K score test incorporates clinical parameters like age, family history, DRE, and prior biopsy history. Therefore, we calculated matrix of correlation coefficients between 4K score test and these predictors. We also ran variance inflation factor analysis (the inflation in the variances of the parameter estimates due to collinearities among predictors) to evaluate the potential presence of substantial multicollinearity between these predictors in our model. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.514,t=0.497,r=0.927,b=0.727), with ID a39eef40-533f-403c-a93c-0b4c14ddba4a -->\n\nAnalysis of correlation coefficients between predictors as well as\nvariance inflation index of predictors did not indicate presence of\nstrong collinearity between 4K and other predictors in our model.\nThere were no strong correlations (>0.8) between 4K score test and\nother predictors.

Additionally, multiple studies have shown that mpMRI helps in identifying a higher proportion of csPCa when compared to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies alone. In the large multicenter, paired-cohort study, PROMIS, (comparing the diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI and TRUS-biopsy against template prostate mapping biopsy), results show that mpMRI and targeted biopsies detected up to 18% more cases of csPCa compared with TRUS-biopsy for all, while avoiding diagnosis of nonsignificant PCa by 5%.^8 However, other studies have shown a wide range of sensitivity for detecting csPCa (44%-87%) as well as negative predictive values ranging from 63%-98%.^7 <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.514,t=0.480,r=0.928,b=0.709), with ID 947d3319-95e5-426d-a65f-ee8b688d1b22 -->\n\nProbabilistic estimates and predictions are being used with\nincreasing frequency in prostate cancer research to guide the\ndecision-making process.

Using our novel prediction model could significantly reduce the large number of biopsies that detect benign or clinically insignificant PCa, while missing only a small proportion of csPCa and uPCa. Our results demonstrate the importance of combining 4K score test, prior negative biopsy, prostate volume, and mpMRI PI-RADS score ≥4 for predicting PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. This novel model could reduce unnecessary biopsies and decrease detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer more effectively than mpMRI or 4K score alone.

External cohort included 622 men. csPCa and uPCa were defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4 and ≥4 + 3 on biopsy, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to build nomogram for predicting PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. Validation was performed by plotting the area under the curve (AUC) and comparing nomogram-predicted probabilities with actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa probabilities in the external cohort. 4K score, a PI-RADS ≥4, prostate volume and prior negative biopsy were significant predictors of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. AUCs were 0.84, 0.88, and 0.86 for the prediction of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa, respectively. The predicted and actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa showed agreement across all percentage probability ranges in the validation cohort. Using the prediction model at threshold of 30, 30% of overall biopsies, 41% of benign biopsies, and 19% of diagnosed indolent PCa could be avoided, while missing 9% of csPCa.",

The 4K score test has repeatedly been shown to predict prostate cancer (PCa) biopsy outcome in men with elevated PSAs while also significantly reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies.⁴⁻⁶ Furthermore, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in combination with targeted biopsies has emerged as an effective tool to detect clinically significant disease.⁷⁻⁹ Studies combining biomarkers and MRI-targeted biopsies for prostate cancer detection have also been proven to decrease the number of biopsies and avoid over-detection of indolent cancer to an even greater extent.¹⁰",

Using our novel prediction model could significantly reduce the large number of biopsies that detect benign or clinically insignificant PCa, while missing only a small proportion of csPCa and uPCa. Our results demonstrate the importance of combining 4K score test, prior negative biopsy, prostate volume, and mpMRI PI-RADS score ≥4 for predicting PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. This novel model could reduce unnecessary biopsies and decrease detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer more effectively than mpMRI or 4K score alone. Thus, this model",

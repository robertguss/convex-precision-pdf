  - Chunk selection
  - Bulk exports

## Critical Path Summary

### Week 1: Foundation

- Complete all Phase 1 tasks (ROB-83, 107, 108, 109, 110)
- These can be worked on in parallel after ROB-83

### Week 2: Payment Unit Tests

- Focus on ROB-111 (Payment/Subscription logic) first
- Then complete other unit tests in parallel

### Week 3: Integration Tests

- Prioritize payment integration tests (ROB-88, 89, 90)
- Complete document-related integration tests

### Week 4: E2E Tests

- Setup Cypress (ROB-104)
- Focus on payment E2E tests (ROB-91) first
- Complete remaining E2E tests

## Important Notes

1. **Payment Priority**: All payment-related tests are marked with ðŸ”´ and should be completed first to address existing bugs

2. **Real API Testing**:
   - FastAPI: Use real service for integration/E2E tests
   - Stripe: Use test mode with real API calls
   - Only mock external services in unit tests

3. **Dependencies are Strict**: Do not skip ahead - each phase builds on the previous

4. **Parallel Work**: Within each phase, multiple issues can be worked on simultaneously by AI agents

5. **Coverage Targets**:
   - Critical payment logic: 95%+
   - Other business logic: 85%+
   - UI Components: 80%+
   - Overall target: 80%+

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All payment bugs resolved through comprehensive testing
- [ ] 80%+ overall code coverage achieved
- [ ] 95%+ coverage on payment/subscription logic
- [ ] All test suites passing in CI/CD
- [ ] E2E tests cover all critical user journeys
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing guidelines

## Next Steps

1. Start with ROB-83 immediately
2. Assign parallel tasks within each phase to AI agents
3. Daily progress reviews focusing on payment test completion
4. Weekly coverage reports to track progress
5. Continuous refactoring of test code for maintainability
